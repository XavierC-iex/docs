    The invitation email provides a link to sign up.

After the team member accepts the agreement terms and creates an account, the IEX Cloud console appears for the new team member. The new team member is added to your Team list.

You can manage the team member's privilege status by toggling the admin status button. Click **Add Admin Status** to add admin privileges or click **Remove Admin Status** to remove them. 

You can remove a team member by clicking the remove icon (x) for that team member.

Now you know how to manage team membership and team member privileges.
