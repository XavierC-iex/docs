# Production-Ready Core Data

IEX Cloud Apperate comes with 5+ terabytes of built-in data to power fintech applications and more. Here are some of the data types:

- Stocks / Equities
- Forex / Currencies
- Options
- Futures
- Commodities
- Economic Data
- Rates
- News
- Symbols / Mappings

```{important} Apperate includes only historical time series Core Data at this time. We are in the process of migrating real-time legacy data, including stock quotes, into Apperate. In the meantime, please see the [Legacy API Reference](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/) for the real-time legacy data.
```

Let's explore the Core Data.

## Exploring Core Data

All the data is available at REST API endpoints, and much of the data is available as [datasets](../reference/glossary.md#dataset) (requires Apperate plan) that you can also use in [views](../managing-your-data/creating-and-managing-views.md). Apperate lists these datasets (Core Data) at [**Data &rarr; Datasets &rarr; Core**](https://iexcloud.io/console/datasets/core).

Like all Apperate datasets, you can access their records via REST endpoints and via the dataset SQL editor.

The [Apperate API Reference](https://iexcloud.io/docs/) describes all the Core Data REST endpoints.

Now you're familiar with Core Data.
